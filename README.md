# ðŸ§  CognitiveReflex.AI
*CognitiveReflex.AI is a trauma-informed agentic AI framework that models major incident recovery cycles in systems engineeringâ€”reframing them through the lens of human memory integration, embodied cognition, and recursive state healing.*

This system reimagines observability not as mere error detection, but as a pathway to **memory repair, adaptive reflexes, and systemic resilience**â€”for both machines and the humans who build, maintain, and evolve them.

**Antifragility, embodied with AI.**
